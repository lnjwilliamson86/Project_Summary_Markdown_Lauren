# Introduction
I am a Senior Research Scientist in the Coke Making Team at QCAT in QLD. My team operates two pilot scale coke ovens and characterises the coke that we produce to support metallurgical coal producers with their marketing efforts. My team deals with quite a large amount of data in excel to facilate the reporting of process data and coke test results to our client. Prior to data school I had no experience in coding in R. 

# My Project
<div class= "col-md-8"> 

The Coke Reactivity Test is routinely carried out at QCAT by the coke making team to assess the quality of coke produced in the Research Coke Oven and Non Recovery Coke Oven. 

A sample of coke is reacted with Carbon Dioxide for a period of two hours at a temperature of 1100oC, The mass loss is indicated by Coke reactivity Index (CRI). The sample is then tumbled to determine the Coke Strength afte Reaction (CSR) which is the mass of coke that remains greater than 10mm in size. The indices indicate the behavior of coke in the iron-making blast furnace. A coke that has a low CRI and high CSR is highly regarded in the market.

My project is to validate the implementation of automated temperature control for the Coke Reactivity Test. ***The questions that we set out to answer through validation testing were; Is there an improvement in the repeatability of the test results? and Is there a difference in the test results between manual and automated control?***

The data collected for this project was both test result data recorded in excel and process data extracted from the control system. The process data had already been manipulated and important process variables such as temperature, recorded in excel.

<!-- I'd like to fix the centring of this image to the middle of the column. Also the preliminary results show in the col unless the picture size is large enough. strangely. --> 

## Preliminary results

Three coke samples with different reactivity were inlcuded in the validation program. Figure \@ref(fig:CRI-vs-CSR-plot)(below) shows the distinct groupings of results, at first glance it also shows that the grouping of results for tests run in automated mode are tighter, idicating that the autoamted method improves the repeatability of the results. 

```{r CRI-vs-CSR-plot, out.width='60%', fig.align='center', fig.height= 4, fig.width=6, fig.cap="CRI vS CSR for Control Samples"}
ggplot (data=all_data, 
        mapping=aes(x= CRI,
                    y= CSR,
                    colour=Mode)) +
  geom_point(aes(shape=Sample),size=2) +
  geom_abline(aes(intercept=100.34,slope=-1.34), colour = "dark green")+
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme_linedraw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")+
  labs(caption= "The green line represents the relationship CSR= 100.34 -1.34*CRI (Koval, Sakurovs & Hockings 2018)")
```
Statistical Analysis of the results data shows: something.... I need to do some analysis on the results data. Initally i was thinking of doing a difference between the two means for each of the control samples but perhaps there is a different method that will be applicable. 

# My Digital Toolbox

Throughout the course of Data School I have learned to use the Tidyverse and the packages within it (e.g.dplyr,readr and tidyr) as well as readxl to import and manipluate data. I have also used ggplot2 to visualise my data. Additionally I have learnt how to use of Git and Github to track changes and collaborate on R projects.

# My time went ...

I spent quite a bit of time tidying and joinging my data into a single dataframe using the `bind_rows()`functions. I also added additional colums of calculated results data using the `mutate()` function. I found it most challenging to deal with time series data, using the Lubridate package. 

# Next steps

I'd like to develop my skills in R coding further and utilise R to conduct data analysis and to generate plots in future research projects. I'm also interested in using R to make it easier and quicker to plot and present untidy data collected by my team to monitor equipment. 

# My Data School Experience

I have enjoyed the experience of learning in a supportive and collaborative environment with people so willing to share their skills, the other really wonderful aspect of data school is that it brings together a diverse group of people from across the country and organisation. I have also  appreciated the opportunity to spend dedicated time on learning a skill that will set me up for success as a reasearcher and team leader. 

# This is a cool plot that I may/may not decide to incorporate

        y= Sample_Temp)) +
